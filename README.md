# Personal note from the author
Please take rest/sleep before the lab test. It is possible that this lab test may be of a very high weightage, and your semester might be in a very very sad state and you might have studied very very hard for this test. It is also possible that you may misplace a pair of brackets, for example, the one around `(randn + 1i*randn)/sqrt(2)` as `randn + 1i*randn/sqrt(2)` in the Monte Carlo simulation and lose a LOT of marks on this lab test. So please, take ample rest. Don't let your hardwork go to waste. This note may be based on the Author's personal experience. ;-;
