# Personal note from the author
Please take rest/sleep before the lab test. It is possible that this lab test may be of a very high weightage, and your semester might be in a very very sad state and you might have studied very very hard for this test. It is also possible that you may misplace a pair of brackets, for example, the one around `(randn + 1i*randn)/sqrt(2)` as `randn + 1i*randn/sqrt(2)` in Monte Carlo simulation and lose a LOT of marks on this lab test. So please, take ample rest. Don't let your hardwork go waste. 

This note may be based on the author's personal experience, and no mention of this episode, if it is real shall be made to the author if met. ;-;
